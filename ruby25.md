# Integer#allbits?, Integer#anybits?, Integer#nobits?

```ruby
number = 0b101010
# => 42
mask   = 0b101000
# => 40
number.allbits?(mask)
# => true
```

# Backward exceptions

- Tired of having to scroll backwards to see where an exception happend?
- Now Ruby will print exceptions in reverse order, but only if output is a TTY
- e.g. so logs by default will retain the original order

def a
  b
end
def b

def c

## rescue / else / ensure can be inside blocks

#### If we wanted to rescue this:

```ruby
[42, 9, 12, 6, 0, 7].each do |number|
  puts "100 divided by #{number} is #{100 / number}"
end
```

#### we'd have to add a `begin / end` block

```ruby
[42, 9, 12, 6, 0, 7].each do |number|
  begin
    puts "100 divided by #{number} is #{100 / number}"
  rescue StandardError => e
    puts "oopsies #{e}"
  end
end
```

## rescue / else / ensure can be inside blocks

#### But now!

```ruby
[42, 9, 12, 6, 0, 7].each do |number|
  puts "100 divided by #{number} is #{100 / number}"
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "oopsies #{e}"
end
```

## Hash transform keys

#### Ever get a hash with keys that are strings but wish they were symbols? (or vice versa?)

```ruby
scores = { "gavin" => 42, "jason" => 98, "toni" => 97, "mark" => 96 }
```

#### Now we can transform the keys

```ruby
scores.transform_keys { |key| key.to_sym }
{:gavin=>42, :jason=>98, :toni=>97, :mark=>96}
```

^ What about key collision

---

# Key collision

```ruby
scores.transform_keys { |key| :oopsies }
# => {:oopsies=>96}
```

---

# Hash Slice

#### Ever just want a hash with *some* of the keys?

```ruby
hash = { name: "Gavin", car: "Tesla", hobby: "Improv", job: "Teaching" }
hash.select { |k,v| [:car, :job].include?(k) }
# => { car: "Tesla", job: "Teaching" }
```

#### Now we can use slice

```ruby
hash.slice(:car, :job)
# => {:car=>"Tesla", :job=>"Teaching"}```
```

---

# String prefix / suffix delete

```ruby

string = "invincible rappers"
string.delete_prefix("in")
# => "vincible rappers"

string = "Ruby is the best language"
string.delete_suffix("language")
# => "Ruby is the best "
```

---

# Array prepend append

#### instead of push and unshift

```
>> names = %w{Gavin}
>> names.unshift("Jason")
# => ["Jason", "Gavin"]
>> names.prepend("Toni")
# => ["Toni", "Jason", "Gavin"]
>> names.push("Mark")
# => ["Toni", "Jason", "Gavin", "Mark"]
>> names.append("Holly")
# => ["Toni", "Jason", "Gavin", "Mark", "Holly"]
```

---

# Integer.sqrt

```
42.sqrt
# => 6
```

### `String#each_grapheme_cluster`

```ruby
flags = "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡«"
flags.each_char { |c| puts c }
# => "ðŸ‡º"
# => "ðŸ‡¸"
# => "ðŸ‡¦"
# => "ðŸ‡«"

flags.each_grapheme_cluster { |grapheme| puts grapheme }
# => ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
# => ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡«
```

---

# Set `to_s`

#### Ruby 2.4

```ruby
require 'set'
names = Set.new(%w{Gavin Jason Toni Mark})
puts names
# => #<Set:0x00007fdff5898bb8>
```

#### Ruby 2.5

```ruby
require 'set'
names = Set.new(%w{Gavin Jason Toni Mark})
puts names
# => #<Set: {"Gavin", "Jason", "Toni", "Mark"}>
```

#### Keyword Structs

```ruby
Dog = Struct.new(:name, :color)
d = Dog.new("Riley", "Brown")
# => #<struct Dog name="Riley", color="Brown">
d.name
# => "Riley"
d.color
# => "Brown"
```

```ruby
Dog = Struct.new(:name, :color, keyword_init: true)
d = Dog.new(color: "Brown", name: "Riley")
# => #<struct Dog name="Riley", color="Brown">
d.name
# => "Riley"
d.color
# => "Brown"
```

#### No more top level constant lookup

```ruby
class Swords; end
class Lasers; end
Swords::Lasers
# => (irb):4: warning: toplevel constant Lasers referenced by Swords::Lasers
# => Lasers < Object
```

#### Dir.children

```ruby
Dir.entries(".")
# => [".", "..", "wat.jpg", ".DS_Store", "winning.gif", "riley.png", "1995.jpg", "sdg.svg"]
Dir.entries(".").reject { |entry| entry == "." || entry == ".." }
# => ["wat.jpg", ".DS_Store", "winning.gif", "riley.png", "1995.jpg", "sdg.svg"]
Dir.children(".")
# => ["wat.jpg", ".DS_Store", "winning.gif", "riley.png", "1995.jpg", "sdg.svg"]
```

---

##### Branch Coverage

```
- Ruby now offers branch coverage
- Can tell the difference between a line being evaluated versus a branch being taken
- This would give us 100% coverage since the `guard clause` was *evaluated*
- Branch coverage would tell us that that clause was never tested
```

```ruby
def oopsies(numerator, denominator)
  return :goaway if denominator.zero?

  numerator/denominator
end

assert_equal 2, oopsies(6,3)
```
